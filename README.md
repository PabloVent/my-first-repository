The most versatile method to quantize field theory is path (functional) integrals:
They’re more rigorous, easier, manifestly Lorentz covariant, more general, and more
pedagogical than canonical quantization. It’s the one method everybody uses, even
though it isn’t the one everyone teaches. (An interesting analogy: 3D physics is
usually taught in Gibbs’s notation, but 4D physics is always taught with index notation, which works for all dimensions.) We use this method to find S-matrices, and
thus cross sections, for general field theories. We use Feynman diagrams (graphs) to
describe the general features, such as unitarity and causality. The group theory of
internal symmetry can also be calculated diagrammatically. Backgrounds fields are
used instead of sources exclusively: All uses of Feynman diagrams involve either the
S-matrix or effective action, both of which require removal of external propagators,
equivalent to replacing sources with fields.
